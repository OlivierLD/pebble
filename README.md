# pebble
Several reusable samples, with Pebble JS.

---

_Aug-2018_: Pebble has been acquired by FitBit a while back, and the online IDE seems not to be available anymore... Too bad, really.
I'm not sure I want to by another watch, that requires a phone to talk to to get any external data.

I'm looking forward to a watch that could use a TCP based protocol to get connected to a network.
**That** would make sense. And if it keeps not showing up, I'll build one ;)

[Pebble Watch](https://www.pebble.com/)

[Cloud IDE](https://cloudpebble.net/)

### How to use those projects
- Create a new PebbleJS project in your [Cloud IDE](https://cloudpebble.net/).
- Copy the content of `app.js` from this project to the IDE.
- If and when images are required:
    - Add them - one by one - in the `RESOURCES` section of the IDE project
    - They will be mentioned in the code, _by their names_ in the `images` directory (`IDENTIFIER` is not used in PebbleJS).
